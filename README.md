### Coursera Project for Getting and Cleaning Data)

This information will help you get and place the data in the proper place on your computer to run the run_analysis.R script also contained in this repo.


### File placement
The data for this project is found in the .zip file available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

You must download that file and extract all files into a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset".

Please NOTE: Be sure that during the extraction you place the files in the correct location. Very often, the file extraction utility will create a folder "UCI HAR Dataset" and then place another folder of the same name. To avoid this, at the dialog box that say "Files will be extracted to this folder" ensure that "UCI HAR Dataset" is not included.

### Packages required

The only package required in the script is the data.table package. The library(data.table) function is included so if you have the package loaded the script will activate the package.
