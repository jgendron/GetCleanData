###Original files in the dataset

All data is based on work by

The merged dataset consisted of eight files:

Dependent Variables:

* y_train.txt - containing activity performed for each observation in the training dataset
* y_test.txt - containing activity performed for each observation in the test dataset

Explanatory Variables:

* X_train.txt - containing the training set of explanatory variable data
* X_test.txt - containing the test set of explanatory variable data

Subject Variables:

* subject_train.txt - containing subjects extracted for the train set
* subject_test.txt - containing subjects used in the test set

Variable Names:

* features.txt - containing names of all the explanatory variables
* activity_labels.txt - containing names of the six dependent variables

###Transformations
1) After reading in all the tables explained above, the train and test datasets were merged into three dataframes using the rbind() command:

* activities - contains the y-train.txt and y-test.txt data
* subjects - contains the subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt data
* data - contains the explanatory variables from X_train.txt and X-test.txt

2) A new variable (activity) was generated by transforming the activities codes into plain names from the file "activity_labels.txt". Additionally, that variable was also transformed into a factor variable.

3) The measures for mean() and std() for each of the measures were extracted from the dataset named data, resulting in a dataset called dataInt 

4) A single data frame called transDatawas created by using the cbind() command to connect the three tables and one new variable in this order:

* [,1] subject {from subjects}
* [,2] activityID {from activities}
* [,3] activity {new variable with plain name of ActivityID}
* [,4:82] by variable features {from dataInt}

5) The tidy data set reduces the number of rows from 10,299 to 180. It provides the data grouped first by subject and then activity. 180 rows meets the tidy data rules because each row is an independent observation of means and standard deviations and each column is a separate variable. This data can then be manipulated by users to summarize means and standard deviations rolled up by subject or by activity.


For purposes of this data analysis, seven variables including the word "Mean" were not included in the tidy dataset as they were not means() of primary variables. Those variables ignored include:

* angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)
* angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)
* angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)
* angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)
* angle(X,gravityMean)
* angle(Y,gravityMean)
* angle(Z,gravityMean)
